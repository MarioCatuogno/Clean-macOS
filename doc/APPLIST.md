# Apps List

Here is a list of useful apps for macOS that have been personally tested and recommended. You can customize your personal profile by selecting the apps that best suit your needs. Simply copy the command from the __Brew__ column and paste it into your Terminal.app or add the name of the app into your `Brewfile` file.

Note: You will need to have Homebrew installed in order to use the commands above. You can install Homebrew by following [this](https://github.com/MarioCatuogno/Clean-macOS/blob/master/doc/SETUP.md) guide.
